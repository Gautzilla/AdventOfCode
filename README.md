Puzzle solvings for Advent of Code : https://adventofcode.com/2021/about

Each year is included in the solution (WIP: I discovered AOC this winter).

Each year has its own Program.cs, where puzzles can be solved using the DayX.Solve(part) method, where X is the nÂ° of the day and the parameter part represents the part 1 or part 2 of the puzzle.

Enjoy!
